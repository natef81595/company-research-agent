## Use Case Examples

### 1. Lead Qualification (B2B Sales)

```python
queries = [
    "What is the company's employee count range?",
    "Does this company have a dedicated sales team?",
    "What is their primary industry vertical?",
    "Do they offer API or developer tools?",
    "What is their pricing model (freemium, subscription, enterprise)?"
]

# Process 1000 companies
# Time: ~5-6 hours
# Cost: ~$50-80
```

### 2. Competitive Intelligence

```python
competitors = ["competitor1.com", "competitor2.com", "competitor3.com"]

queries = [
    "What are their main product features?",
    "What is their pricing compared to our product?",
    "What integrations do they offer?",
    "What is their target customer size?",
    "What are their recent product updates?"
]

# Get comprehensive competitor profiles
# Update monthly
```

### 3. Market Research

```python
market_segment_companies = [...]  # 100+ companies

queries = [
    "What pain points do they address?",
    "What is their go-to-market strategy?",
    "Who are their main customers?",
    "What is their differentiation?",
]

# Build market landscape report
```

### 4. Compliance Checking

```python
vendors = [...]  # All your vendors

queries = [
    "Do they have SOC2 Type II certification?",
    "Are they GDPR compliant?",
    "Do they have ISO 27001?",
    "What is their data residency policy?",
    "Do they have a bug bounty program?"
]

# Automated vendor compliance tracking
# Run quarterly
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Multi-Page Crawling

```python
def research_with_crawl(domain, query, max_pages=5):
    """Crawl multiple pages to find information"""
    pages_to_check = [
        domain,
        f"{domain}/about",
        f"{domain}/products",
        f"{domain}/security"
    ]
    
    for page in pages_to_check:
        result = agent.research_attribute(page, query)
        if result['success'] and result['result'].get('found'):
            return result
    
    return {"found": False, "message": "Not found after checking multiple pages"}
```

### 2. Confidence Scoring

```python
def get_confidence_score(result):
    """Calculate confidence based on multiple factors"""
    score = 0
    
    if result.get('evidence'):
        score += 40  # Has evidence
    
    if len(result.get('answer', '')) > 50:
        score += 30  # Detailed answer
    
    if result.get('confidence') == 'high':
        score += 30
    elif result.get('confidence') == 'medium':
        score += 15
    
    return score  # 0-100
```

### 3. Retry Logic with Different Models

```python
def research_with_fallback(domain, query):
    """Try multiple approaches if first fails"""
    
    # Try optimized approach first
    result = agent.research_with_optimization(domain, query)
    
    if not result['success'] or result['result'].get('confidence') == 'low':
        # Try different section
        result = agent.research_attribute(domain, query)
    
    if not result['success']:
        # Try with web search
        result = web_search_approach(domain, query)
    
    return result
```

## Integration Ideas

### 1. CRM Integration
```python
# Enrich Salesforce/HubSpot records
for lead in crm.get_leads():
    attributes = agent.research_attribute(
        lead.domain,
        "What products does this company offer?"
    )
    crm.update_lead(lead.id, {'products': attributes['result']['answer']})
```

### 2. Slack Notifications
```python
# Alert on new companies matching criteria
result = agent.research_attribute(domain, "Is this a Series B+ company?")
if result['result']['answer'].lower() == 'yes':
    slack.send_message(f"🎯 New qualified lead: {domain}")
```

### 3. Automated Reports
```python
# Weekly competitive intelligence report
results = agent.batch_research_optimized(competitors, queries)
generate_pdf_report(results)
send_email_report(to="team@company.com")
```

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Query Design
✅ Good: "Does this company have SOC2 Type II certification?"
❌ Bad: "Tell me about their security"

✅ Good: "List the main products offered by this company"
❌ Bad: "What do they do?"

✅ Good: "What is the company's target customer size (SMB/Mid-market/Enterprise)?"
❌ Bad: "Who buys from them?"

### 2. Section Hints
You can guide the agent by modifying the location detection logic:
- Certifications → footer, security, trust pages
- Products → products, solutions, services pages  
- Pricing → pricing, plans pages
- Company info → about, company pages

### 3. Output Format Selection
- **Boolean**: For yes/no questions
- **List**: For enumerating multiple items
- **Structured**: For complex answers with confidence scores
- **Text**: For simple explanations

### 4. Batch Processing Strategy
- Group similar queries together
- Cache website content when asking multiple questions
- Process in parallel (carefully with rate limits)
- Export to CSV for easy analysis

## Conclusion

Your DIY agent gives you:
✅ Full control and customization
✅ Lower cost at scale (2000+ queries/month)
✅ No platform lock-in
✅ Can integrate with any system
✅ Learn and improve the system

Consider Clay if:
- You need 50+ data providers integrated
- You prefer no-code solutions
- You want managed infrastructure
- You need <1000 queries/month
